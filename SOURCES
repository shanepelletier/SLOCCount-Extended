"CodeCount" toolset for counting SLOC.
  http://sunset.usc.edu/research/CODECOUNT/
Covers C/C++/Ada/Java and a few others, but
NOT Python, TCL, Perl, or LISP.
I used this to count C, C++, and Java code.
These tools are under a GPL-like license, but it's NOT the GPL.
See their website for more info.

A huge list of tools is at (mostly big $$):

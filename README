SLOCCount README
=================

This directory contains "SLOCCount", a set of the programs for counting
source lines of code (SLOC) in large software systems.
It was developed by David A. Wheeler (dwheeler@dwheeler.com),
originally to count SLOC in a Linux (GNU/Linux) system, but it can be
used for counting other software systems.

Some of the files contained in this directory aren't normally used -
instead, they're scrap special-purpose files I used when I created these
programs.  Feel free to use them, but if you're packaging this program,
be selective - don't install in /usr/bin every executable here!
Just install the ones documented, plus the executables they depend on.

Packagers: I've developed an RPM spec file and RPM, so RPM systems can
just load-and-go.  If you use a different package format, you may still
find the spec file helpful for identifying what to load, and the "alien"
program can apparantly translate the RPM file to Debian '.deb' format
without any problem.

Debian already includes a SLOCCount package.
SLOCCount 2.08 is available in Debian 3.0.
More info on the status of SLOCCount in Debian should see
